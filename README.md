# Project for University (3rd year)

## For my project I will be creating a 2d mobile game aimed at measuring the efficiency in which
the user can complete a couple of Boolean equations as well as increasing said efficiency
through some exercises. The challenge in my project would not only be to make an interesting
and enjoyable game but also to figure out methods through which I can keep track of userâ€™s
times and improve said times.
